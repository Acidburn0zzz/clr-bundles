# This list defines package-scope bundles
# Each line contains a single package name which will be generated as a bundle
# of the same name containing only that package.
#
# Generally these are for things in /usr/bin or system services,
# not for libraries and the like. Even with package-bundles, bundles
# should remain self contained functionality as an end-user would
# perceive it.
#
# Do not remove things from this list without very careful coordination
# with devops
#
# This file should remain sorted
