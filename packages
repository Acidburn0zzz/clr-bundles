# This list defines package-scope bundles.
# Each line contains a single package name (which will be generated as a bundle
# of the same name containing only that package) and its corresponding
# description.
#
# Generally these are for things in /usr/bin or system services,
# not for libraries and the like. Even with package-bundles, bundles
# should remain self contained functionality as an end-user would
# perceive it.
#
# Do not remove things from this list without very careful coordination
# with devops.
#
# This file should remain sorted.
